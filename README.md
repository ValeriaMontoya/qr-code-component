## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Trough this project I was able to practice Sass for the first time, so it's been a great experience working differently with styles.

### Continued development

In future projects I'd like to keep using Sass to write CSS, as it allows for more modularity and makes the code easier to maintain.
